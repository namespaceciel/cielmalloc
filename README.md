This project is a lock-free memory allocator written in C++20 only for educational purposes, highly inspired by [Microsoft snmalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/snmalloc)'s [paper](https://github.com/microsoft/snmalloc/blob/main/snmalloc.pdf) and its initial commit, and some simplifications were made as well.
